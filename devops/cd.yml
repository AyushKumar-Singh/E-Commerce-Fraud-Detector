# CD Pipeline Reference
# Main workflows:
#   - ../.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml (deploy-staging, deploy-production)
#   - ../.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml (Docker image publishing)
#   - ../.github/workflows/k8s-deploy.yml (Kubernetes deployment)

# This file provides a quick reference to the CD configuration.

# Deployment Workflows:
#
# 1. Automatic Deployment (ci-cd.yml):
#    - deploy-staging: Triggered on push to 'develop' branch
#    - deploy-production: Triggered on push to 'main' branch
#
# 2. Docker Publishing (docker-publish.yml):
#    - Builds multi-platform images (amd64, arm64)
#    - Pushes to GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io)
#    - Triggered on main branch and version tags
#
# 3. Kubernetes Deploy (k8s-deploy.yml):
#    - Manual trigger with environment selection
#    - Uses Kustomize for manifest management
#    - Supports staging and production environments

# Required GitHub Secrets:
# - GITHUB_TOKEN (automatic)
# - DOCKERHUB_USERNAME (optional)
# - DOCKERHUB_TOKEN (optional)
# - KUBE_CONFIG (for K8s deployment, base64 encoded)
